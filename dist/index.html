    Kanye West is one of the most critically acclaimed musicians of the 21st century and is one of the best selling music artists of time with 140 million records sold worldwide. He has won 21 Grammy awards. Time magazine also named him one of the 100 most influential people in 2005 and 2015. However, the most important aspect of what makes an artist great is their critical success. It doesn’t matter how many sales an artist has; they won’t ever have any legacy or influence if they don’t make good music. The good thing about Kanye West is he does exactly that.
